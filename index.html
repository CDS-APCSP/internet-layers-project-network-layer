    <h2>Network Layer Explination</h2>
    <p> The network layer is when computers communicate over multiple different networks. The network layer decides which physical path the data will take. It handles the routing, packaging, and sending of data that goes over multiple networks. “If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary”. The network layer will break down the transportation layer into packets and then assemble them on the receiving network. Then they use routing which will try and find the best physical path for the data to travel. Packets are basic forms of data that are grouped together and then they are transferred over a computer network. </p>

    <h2>Comparison Between OSI and TCP/IP Models</h2>
    <h3>OSI Model</h3>
    <p>  The open systems interconnection model (OSI) provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other. The OSI model is composed of seven layers --- data travels over these layers. “Each layer has some function that prepares the data to be sent over wires, cables, and radio waves as a series of bits.” </p>
    <h3>TCP/IP Model</h3>
    <p> The network layer is parallel to the internet layer in the TCP model. There are four main layers. The internet layer consists of three main protocols. The first being the internet protocol (IP) which is responsible for delivering these packets from the source to the destination by looking at their IP addresses. The second protocol is the internet control message protocol (ICMP). This is information in your IP. It is responsible for providing the host information about network problems. The last protocol is the address resolution protocol (ARP). This protocol's job is to find the hardware address from an IP. There are four types of ARP: Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, Gratuitous ARP and Inverse ARP. </p>
